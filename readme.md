# **Tumble Launch Rebalance**

## **Make tumble launch just a tad better!**

**This mod buffs the Tumble Launch upgrade through a durability buff.**

Ever spend a significant amount of your hard earned money on more than few tumble-launch upgrades, only to be sorely disappointed at how quickly you get annihilated when using it? Flying down a dark hallway at unprescedented speeds only to be put down by a poorly placed enemy?

This mod aims to fix that through two changes: contact damage from hitting an enemy while tumbling no longer deals a flat 5 damage, and scaling damage reduction from each Tumble Launch owned.

The damage received while tumbling is as follows:

$$\text{damage} \times \max(1 - \text{max\\_damage\\_reduction}, 1 - \frac{\text{tumble\\_upgrades\\_owned } \times \text{max\\_damage\\_reduction}}{\text{upgrades\\_for\\_max\\_reduction}})$$
