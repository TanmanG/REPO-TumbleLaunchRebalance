# **Tumble Launch Rebalance**

## **Make tumble launch just a tad better!**

**This mod buffs the Tumble Launch upgrade through a durability buff.**

Ever spend a significant amount of your hard earned money on more than few tumble-launch upgrades, only to be sorely disappointed at how quickly you get annihilated when using it? Flying down a dark hallway at unprescedented speeds only to be put down by a poorly placed enemy?

This mod aims to fix that through two changes: contact damage from hitting an enemy while tumbling no longer deals a flat 5 damage, and scaling damage reduction from each Tumble Launch owned.

The damage received while tumbling is as follows:

$$\mbox{Effective Damage} = \text{damage} \times 1 - \text{max\\_damage\\_reduction} \times \min(1, \frac{\text{tumble\\_upgrades\\_owned }}{\text{upgrades\\_to\\_reach\\_max\\_reduction}})$$
